        <p class="DefinitionListBody">SQL diagnostic manager version 8.5 and later is designed to trigger an alert response only after multiple metric thresholds are breached when the “Where all metrics are in specified list” condition is selected. However, an issue in the “Send a Network Management (SNMP) Trap Message”, “Send an email to recipient”, and “Run the following SQL Script” actions of the Alert Response Window cause these actions to execute several times, resulting in multiple alerts.</p>

        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Some users may experience an interruption due to memory corruption in their SQLdm installation after selecting the SQL Server instance on which they want to install their SQLdm Repository.

        <h2 class="Heading2">Installation and configuration considerations</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">SQLdm Repository computer must run Microsoft SQL&#160;Server 2005 or later</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">SQLdm 7.0 and later require Microsoft SQL&#160;Server 2005 or later running on the computer that hosts the SQLdm Repository database for all installations.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">SQLdm Console only users cannot upgrade to the full version without uninstalling SQLdm</p>

        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Registering a SQL Server instance that uses an Alias Name requires an alias on the host computer</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">When registering a SQL Server instance using the alias name, an alias must first be created on the computer that hosts the SQLdm Management and Collection Services. If the instance uses Named Pipes, Named Pipes must be enabled in the SQL Server network configuration of the aliased SQL Server instance.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Management Service does not start when the account permissions are incorrect</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">If the account you specified for the SQLdm services does not have System Administrator privileges on the SQL Server instance hosting the Repository database, the setup program cannot start the SQLdm Management Service.

        <p class="DefinitionListBody">To resolve this issue, use the Management Service Configuration wizard to specify credentials for a Windows account or SQL Server login that has System Administrator privileges on the SQL Server instance hosting the Repository database.

If Predictive Analytics is not detected or is disabled, SQLdm cannot generate baseline data for the requested report. The following reports require the Predictive Analysis Service to include baseline-related results:</p>
