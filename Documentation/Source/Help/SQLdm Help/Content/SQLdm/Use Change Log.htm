        <p class="Body">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Change Log" />Granted the number and different types of users in SQL Server production environments, keeping track of changes to your SQLdm configuration is critical. Through the Change Log you can view a list of key actions performed in your SQLdm environment, such as when a server is added for monitoring, an alert configuration or grooming configuration is changed. The Change Log view gives thorough and instant information on modifications.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Change Log view is available by default in SQLdm versions 8.0 or later.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Access the Change Log view</h2>
