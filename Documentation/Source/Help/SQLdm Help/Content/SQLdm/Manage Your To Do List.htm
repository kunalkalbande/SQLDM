While users who had To Do activated in an earlier 6.x version can continue to  use To Do items, this version of SQLdm does not support this feature for new users. Current To Do users can reference Idera Solution for information on how to enable the To Do view.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="To Do List:manage" />The To Do List helps <a href="Configure how SQLdm responds to alerts.htm">draw immediate attention to critical alerts</a>. You can use this list to remain apprised of the progress made to correct problems. When completed, DBAs can easily check <span class="GUI_Item">Done </span>and cross out the item. </p>
        <p class="Body">While working on an item, the DBA can make comments in the editable <span class="GUI_Item">Comments</span> field. Resolving alerts displayed in the To Do list also clears the alert notification in the navigation tree. Marking a To Do item completed does not clear the notification if the alert situation continues.</p>
        <p class="Body">The To Do list also serves as an entry point into investigating the cause of alerts. While not all alerts have corresponding view in SQLdm, a great number do. If you double-click a To Do List item associated with a SQLdm view, SQLdm launches the appropriate view.</p>
        <p class="Body">From the To Do list window, you can edit the properties of any To Do List item by selecting the item, and either changing the status or owner, or adding comments as to how to resolve the issue or the steps taken to resolve it in the <span class="GUI_Item">Details</span> section.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can filter items in the To Do list <a href="Working with Tags.htm" target="_self">based on the tags</a> <![CDATA[ ]]>assigned to those items.</p>
