        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Idera Newsfeed for SQLdm</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">The Idera Newsfeed is a user interface that seamlessly integrates with the SQLdm Console, letting you monitor your instances and collaborate with coworkers at the same time, in real time.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Idera Newsfeed Platform</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">The Idera Newsfeed Platform consists of the SQLdm Mobile Repository database and the SQLdm Mobile &amp; Newsfeed Service.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">SQLdm Mobile Repository database</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">The SQLdm Mobile Repository (Mobile Repository) is a central database that stores your configuration settings, comments and other activity on stories, as well as notifications.  Consider deploying the Mobile Repository to the same computer that hosts your SQLdm Repository.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">SQLdm Mobile &amp; Newsfeed Service</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">The SQLdm Mobile &amp; Newsfeed Service facilitates communications between the SQLdm Mobile Repository and your SQLdm application. By default, this service is installed on the same computer where you run the SQLdm Mobile &amp;&#160;Newsfeed setup program. Consider SQLdm Mobile &amp; Newsfeed Service  to the same computer that hosts your SQLdm Services, such as the SQLdm Management Service.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Action Provider</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">The Idera Newsfeed Action Provider converts SQLdm alerts about a server's status and performance metrics into notification emails that SQLdm Mobile &amp; Newsfeed Service can send to the appropriate people. The setup program installs the action provider on the computer hosting your SQLdm Repository.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Authentication Provider</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">The  Idera Newsfeed Authentication Provider is the SQLdm application that the Idera Newsfeed Platform uses to authenticate a user when he or she signs up or logs on.

        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">SQLdm Mobile Web application (Web site)</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBodyLast">The SQLdm Mobile Web site provides access to the same monitoring and collaboration features of the Idera Newsfeed technology via a mobile device, such as a smart phone or iPad.
