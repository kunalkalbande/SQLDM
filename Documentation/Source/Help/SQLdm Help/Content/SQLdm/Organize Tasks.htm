        <h1 class="Heading1">Organize tasks</h1>
        <p class="Body">Your To Do lists can grow large over time, particularly if you are monitoring a large number of SQL Server instances. When you have a large number of Tasks in your list, consider organizing your tasks so that you can resolve the most important tasks first. You can organize tasks by either the <span class="GUI_Item">Current View</span> or by <span class="GUI_Item">Filter</span>.</p>
        <p class="Body">Note that beginning with SQLdm 7.0, the To Do feature is available only to users who had To Do activated in an earlier 6.x version. This version of SQLdm does not support this feature for new users.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Organize your tasks with Current View</h2>
        <p class="Body">Organize your tasks by selecting Active, Completed, By Owner, By Status, or Custom from the Current View section of the navigation pane.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Organize your tasks using the filter</h2>
        <p class="Body">Click <span class="GUI_Item">Show Filter Options</span> in the Navigation Pane to open the To Do List filter. You can select filter options such as the severity, status, SQL&#160;Server instance, the owner, and the time range you would like to see. </p>
