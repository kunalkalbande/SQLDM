        <h1 class="Heading1">Table Growth Forecast</h1>
        <p class="Body">The Table Growth Forecast report lets you predict how large selected tables may grow based on current and historical growth rate trends. For more accurate forecasting, select the largest possible period of historical data and the shortest possible projection into the future. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">When to run this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">You should run the Table Growth Forecast report to help anticipate your needs  and plan for future creation of additional tables.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Available forecast types</h2>
        <p class="Body">You can choose Linear or Exponential (Aggressive) forecasting types when you run this report.</p>
        <p class="Body">Linear forecasting follows the trend of the available data and extends the forecast out in a straight line by the number of forecast units.</p>
        <p class="Body">Exponential forecasting tends to exaggerate the trend that exists in the data. This allows you to more easily see if your data (table growth) is trending toward or away from a critical threshold. If the rate of growth is not constant, the exponential forecast type gives a more accurate forecast of future growth.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">How SQLdm calculates metric values on this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">Most values on the Table Growth Forecast report correlate with the related SQL Server metric.</p>
        <p class="Body">However, some metric values represent averages over time. Likewise, a few metric values are based on performance algorithms that use multiple statistics to calculate a more accurate metric.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can access our <a href="http://www.idera.com/support" target="_blank">Customer Service Portal</a> (www.idera.com/support) for more information about the algorithm used to calculate a specific metric.</p>
