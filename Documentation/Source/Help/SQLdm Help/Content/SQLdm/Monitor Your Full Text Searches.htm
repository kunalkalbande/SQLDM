        <h1 class="Heading1">Monitor full text searches</h1>
        <p class="Body">Use the Full-Text Search to monitor and diagnose problems with the SQL&#160;Server Full-Text Search service. The view is composed of a single list that displays information about each Full-Text catalog maintained on a monitored SQL&#160;Server. You can view Catalog details by selecting a Full-Text Catalog from the list.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Services:full-text searches">
            </MadCap:keyword>The Full-Text Search view lists all the full-text search catalogs that are hosted on the SQL&#160;Server instance as well as their statuses. You can also start or stop the Full-Text Search service, optimize or rebuild the catalogs.</p>
        <p class="Body">For each catalog listed, the database, status, size, and last population date is listed. In addition, selecting any catalog from the list populates the <span class="GUI_Item">Catalog Details</span>  section. This section includes information on the tables, rows, columns, catalogs, language, and column data types included in the Full-Text search.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Access the Full-Text Search view</h2>
        <p class="Body">You can open the Full-Text Search view of the SQLdm Services tab by selecting the appropriate SQL&#160;Server instance, and then clicking <span class="GUI_Item">Services &gt; Full-Text Search</span>.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Optimize or Rebuild my Full-Text Catalog</h2>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Optimize</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">When you select the <span class="GUI_Item">Optimize</span> button, SQL Server optimizes the space utilization of the catalog and improve query performance as well as the accuracy of relevance rankings of search results.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Rebuild</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBodyLast">When you select the <span class="GUI_Item">Rebuild</span> button, SQL Server repopulates the full-text search index.</p>
