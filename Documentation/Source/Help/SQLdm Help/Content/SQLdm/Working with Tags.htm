        <h1 class="Heading1">Work with tags</h1>
        <p class="Body">Tags are customizable labels that allow you to organize and view your monitored resources in a manner best suited to your needs. You can assign tags to monitored SQL&#160;Server instances, custom counters, and permissions.</p>
        <p class="Body">By creating and assigning tags to different objects, you can better manage how SQLdm presents information. For example, you may create an "Accounting" tag for all SQL&#160;Server instances used by the Accounting department. You could then copy alert configuration and assign custom counters and permissions to all the instances labeled "Accounting." </p>
        <p class="Body">Tags are also accessible to all users. This gives you greater freedom, allowing users to work with the same tags across all SQLdm consoles.</p>
