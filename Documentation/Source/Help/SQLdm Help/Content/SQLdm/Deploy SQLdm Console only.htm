        <p class="Body">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Deploy:SQLdm Console only;Console only:deploy" />Idera provides a solution for administrators who have SQLdm deployed within their environment, and want to provide their users with the SQLdm desktop client console without exposing other SQLdm components. Administrators can use this process to prevent a user from unknowingly installing an additional service component, which can cause issues with SQLdm within your environment.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Store the SQLdm Console-only executable</h2>
        <p class="Body">You can store the SQLdm Console-only executable (.exe) files on many types of media for distribution, such as a portable or network drive. Your end users can install the SQLdm desktop client console on any computer that meets or exceeds the <a href="SQLdm requirements.htm">product requirements</a>.</p>
        <p class="Body">The following files reside in the location where you installed SQLdm. Copy one or both of these files to your distribution media. Note the first file is for x64 users and the second is for x86 users.</p>
        <p class="BodyIndent"><code>c:\Program Files\Idera\SQLdm x64 Installation Kit\x64\SQLDiagnosticManager-x64_c.exe</code>
        </p>
        <p class="BodyIndent"><code>c:\Program Files\Idera\SQLdm x86 Installation Kit\x86\SQLDiagnosticManager_c.exe</code>
