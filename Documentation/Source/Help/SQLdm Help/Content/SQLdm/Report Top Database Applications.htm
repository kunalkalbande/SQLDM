        <h1 class="Heading1">Top Database Applications</h1>
        <p class="Body">The Top Database Applications report lets you find the applications that are consuming the highest amount of your system resources, such as CPU usage, when run on a specific database. You can define minimum thresholds for each of these performance metrics and then see which applications match or exceed the selected values. This report requires that you enabled Query Monitoring in the SQLdm Console and have collected sufficient query data for the specified time period.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">When to run this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">You should run the Top Database Applications report on a routine basis, such as every week, to proactively identify potential performance issues that may be caused by third-party applications. You can also use this report to track historic performance trends and determine the relationship between third-party application usage and your database performance.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">How SQLdm calculates metric values on this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">Most values on the Top Database Applications report correlate with the related SQL Server metric. However, some metric values represent averages over time. Likewise, a few metric values are based on performance algorithms that use multiple statistics to calculate a more accurate metric.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can access our <a href="http://www.idera.com/support" target="_blank">Customer Service Portal</a> (www.idera.com/support) for more information about the algorithm used to calculate a specific metric.</p>
