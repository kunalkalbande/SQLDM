        <h1 class="Heading1">Top Tables by Growth</h1>
        <p class="Body">The Top Tables by Growth report identifies the fastest growing tables in a database. You can select a specific database to analyze or evaluate all databases on a specific SQL Server instance. You can also choose a growth metric and its minimum threshold to see which tables match or exceed the selected value.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">When to run this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">You should run the Top Tables by Growth report on a routine basis, depending on how heavily your company uses the host SQL&#160;Server instance. Use this report to see how rapidly (or slowly) tables are growing over time. <span class="If_Then_Statement">If database capacity on a given instance becomes limited</span>, run this report to see a list of tables that are the top contributors and decide whether you want to move them to another database.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">How SQLdm calculates metric values on this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">Most values on the Top Tables by Growth report correlate with the related SQL Server metric.</p>
        <p class="Body">However, some metric values represent averages over time. Likewise, a few metric values are based on performance algorithms that use multiple statistics to calculate a more accurate metric.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can access our <a href="http://www.idera.com/support" target="_blank">Customer Service Portal</a> (www.idera.com/support) for more information about the algorithm used to calculate a specific metric.</p>
