        <h1 class="Heading1">Deploy SQLdm reports to Reporting Services</h1>
        <p class="Body">In addition to the included reports, SQLdm also allows you to generate reports using Microsoft Reporting Services. Microsoft Reporting Services allows you to build powerful, <a href="Select Reports to Deploy.htm">custom reports to deploy</a> for a comprehensive auditing solution.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Access the Reports Deployment wizard</h2>
        <p class="Body">SQLdm provides two paths to access the Reports Deployment wizard where you can select reports to deploy to a Microsoft Reporting Services Server. The first path is by clicking ‘Deploy them now' at the bottom of the <b>Reports &gt; Getting Started view</b>. The second path is by first selecting a specific report in the <b>Reports &gt; Getting Started view</b>, and then clicking the Deploy Report option from the Navigation Pane.</p>
        <p class="Body">In order to use this feature, you must have access to a server with Microsoft Reporting Services. For more information about Reporting Services, see the Microsoft document, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb522712.aspx" target="_blank">Reporting Services Reports</a>.</p>
