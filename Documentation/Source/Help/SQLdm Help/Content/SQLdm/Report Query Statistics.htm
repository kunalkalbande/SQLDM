        <h1 class="Heading1">Query Statistics</h1>
        <p class="Body">The Query Statistics report lets you view details for an individual SQL&#160;statement or signature as collected by the Query Monitor. This report requires that you enabled Query Monitoring in the SQLdm Console and have collected sufficient query data for the specified time period.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">When to run this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">You should run the Query Statistics report to analyze an individual SQL&#160;statement or signature for a monitored instance. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">How SQLdm calculates metric values on this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">Most values on the Query Statistics report correlate with the related SQL Server metric. However, some metric values represent averages over time. Likewise, a few metric values are based on performance algorithms that use multiple statistics to calculate a more accurate metric.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can access our <a href="http://www.idera.com/support" target="_blank">Customer Service Portal</a> (www.idera.com/support) for more information about the algorithm used to calculate a specific metric.</p>
