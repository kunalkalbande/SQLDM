            <MadCap:keyword term="virtualization;VM;VMware;virtual machine;ESX;virtual;host;Hyper-V" />The Virtualization Statistics report provides an analysis of your virtualization performance trends for a virtualized machine monitored by SQLdm. Select the appropriate instance and SQLdm displays the Virtualization Statistics report using your selected chart type.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">When to run this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">You can run the Virtualization Statistics report when you are concerned about a virtualized machine and its performance. This report allows you to see the CPU, memory, disk, and network performance metrics for the selected VM and period of time.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">How SQLdm calculates metric values on this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">Most values on the Virtualization Statistics report correlate with the related SQL Server metric. However, some metric values represent averages over time. Likewise, a few metric values are based on performance algorithms that use multiple statistics to calculate a more accurate metric.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can access our <a href="http://www.idera.com/support" target="_blank">Customer Service Portal</a> (www.idera.com/support) for more information about the algorithm used to calculate a specific metric.</p>
