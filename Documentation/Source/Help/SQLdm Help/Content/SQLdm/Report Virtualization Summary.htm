This report includes information about the VM as well as configuration of the host server. Click the appropriate instance and SQLdm displays the Virtualization Summary report.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">When to run this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">You can run the Virtualization Summary report to view a quick overview of the health and performance of the virtualized environment for your selected monitored instance. Run this report when you want a quick glance at the VM information for this instance.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">How SQLdm calculates metric values on this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">Most values on the Virtualization Summary report correlate with the related SQL Server metric. However, some metric values represent averages over time. Likewise, a few metric values are based on performance algorithms that use multiple statistics to calculate a more accurate metric.</p>
