            <MadCap:keyword term="Upgrade:SQLdm Console only;Console only:upgrade" />SQLdm allows users to install a full version, which includes the SQLdm Repository, Management Service, and Management Console, or you can install the SQLdm desktop client console by itself when you already have a full version of SQLdm installed in your environment. </p>
        <p class="Body">Users who have an installation of SQLdm Console only on a computer can use the upgrade to update their current version of the desktop client console, but cannot use the upgrade program to install the full version of SQLdm.</p>
