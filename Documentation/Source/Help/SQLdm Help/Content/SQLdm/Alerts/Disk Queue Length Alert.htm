        <h1 class="Heading1">OS Average Disk Queue Length (Count) alert </h1>
        <p class="Body">The OS&#160;Average Disk Queue Length (Count) alert provides the average number of both read and write requests queued for all the disks on the SQL Server computer. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Reduce queue length</h2>
        <p class="Body"> If this queue often remains above six per physical disk for more than 10 seconds at a time, then your disk subsystem is overloaded.   In this case consider the following:
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">Check OS Paging to make sure that paging from/to the swap file is not causing these IOs.
</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Replacing disks with faster disks.
</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Add more disks to you RAID array.
</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Switch your RAID array from RAID 5 to RAID 10 solution as each write IO results in two writes using RAID 10 vs. 4 for RAID 5.
</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Move other applications to another computer.
</li>
            <li class="Bullet">So long as the RAID controller has some form of battery backup then switch its cache mode from Write-through to Write-back as this increases the system ability to handle write IOs by an order of magnitude.
</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">If the computer is running multiple instances of SQL Server, then consider placing each instance on a separate physical computer.
</li>
        </ul>
