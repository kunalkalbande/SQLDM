        <h1 class="Heading1"> OS Memory Usage (Percent) alert</h1>
        <p class="Body">The OS&#160;Memory Usage (Percent) alert provides the percentage of physical and virtual memory. Consistently high Total Memory Usage could indicate either:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">A memory leak in a program in use.</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">A need to increase the amount of total memory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">The Memory view on the Resources tab allows you to track the Total Memory usage along with other key memory statistics on the computer hosting your SQL Server instance.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Reduce OS&#160;memory usage</h2>
        <p class="Body">A high percentage of Total Memory Usage indicates a memory bottleneck. To investigate this issue, open the Memory view on the Resources tab to view how memory is utilized on your SQL Server instance. You may need to allocate more memory to SQL Server to increase your SQL Server performance, or limit the usage of other applications on the computer hosting your SQL Server instance.</p>
