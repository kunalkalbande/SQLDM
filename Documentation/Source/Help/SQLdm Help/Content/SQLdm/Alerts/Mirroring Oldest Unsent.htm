        <h1 class="Heading1">Mirroring Oldest Unsent Transactions (Minutes) alert</h1>
        <p class="Body">The Mirroring Oldest Unsent Transactions (Minutes)  alert provides the age of unsent transactions queued on the processor and reached an alert threshold. </p>
        <p class="Body">This alert specifies the number of minutes worth of transactions that can accumulate in the send queue before a warning is generated on the principal server instance. This warning helps measure the potential for data loss in terms of time and is especially relevant for high-performance mode. However, the warning is also relevant for high-safety mode when mirroring is paused or suspended because the partners become disconnected.</p>
        <p class="Body">This alert is raised based on the diagnostic data collection interval specified in Server Properties. For more information, see <a href="../Set general server options.htm" target="_self">Set general server options</a>.</p>
        <p class="Body">For more information about oldest unsent transactions, see the Microsoft document, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms408393.aspx" target="_blank">Use Warning Thresholds and Alerts on Mirroring Performance Metrics (SQL Server)</a>.</p>
