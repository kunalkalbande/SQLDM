        <h1 class="Heading1">OS Disk Time (Percent) alert</h1>
        <p class="Body">The OS&#160;Disk Time (Percent) alert provides the percentage of elapsed time that all disks are busy servicing read and write requests on the SQL&#160;Server computer.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Reduce OS processor time</h2>
        <p class="Body">   If this value regularly exceeds 75%, you should take action such as:
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">Reduce the number of SQL re-compilations since they are CPU intensive. There are many reasons that an object such as a stored procedure is recompiled and you can remove most of these reasons by careful coding. See the SQL Re-compilations counter for ways to dramatically reduce recompiles.
</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Make sure that all T-SQL statements (whether in a stored procedure, trigger, or ad hoc statement) that reference objects fully qualify the object referenced. <br />For example: <code>SELECT * FROM Northwind.dbo Employees</code> is a fully-qualified object reference whereas <code>SELECT * FROM Employees</code> is a poorly-qualified object. You can reuse the execution plans of fully-qualified objects "as is," whereas plans where you either cannot reuse the not fully-qualified objects or, if they are reused, then they are subject to a highly restrictive <code>COMPILE </code>lock while SQL Server determines if all of the objects referenced in the T-SQL code have the same owners as the execution plan currently in cache. Both of these situations consume a significant amount of CPU time.
</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">Stop unnecessary programs (such as the Print Spooler or activities such as the database server acting as either a BDC or PDC) from running. 
</li>
        </ul>
