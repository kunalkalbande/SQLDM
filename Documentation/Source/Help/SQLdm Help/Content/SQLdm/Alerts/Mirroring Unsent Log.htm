        <h1 class="Heading1">Mirroring Unsent Log (KB) alert</h1>
        <p class="Body">The Mirroring Unsent Log (KB) alert indicates that the amount of unsent logs (in KB) queued on the mirrored database reached or exceeded an alert threshold. </p>
        <p class="Body">This alert specifies how many kilobytes (KB) of unsent logs generate a warning on the principal server instance. This warning helps measure the potential for data loss in terms of KB and is especially relevant for high-performance mode. However, the warning is also relevant for high-safety mode when mirroring is paused or suspended because the partners become disconnected.</p>
        <p class="Body">This alert is raised based on the diagnostic data collection interval specified in Server Properties. For more information, see <a href="../Set general server options.htm" target="_self">Set general server options</a>.</p>
        <p class="Body">For more information about unsent logs, see the Microsoft document, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms408393.aspx" target="_blank">Use Warning Thresholds and Alerts on Mirroring Performance Metrics (SQL Server)</a>.</p>
