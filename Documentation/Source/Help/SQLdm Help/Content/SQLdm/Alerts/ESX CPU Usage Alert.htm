        <p class="Body">
            <MadCap:keyword term="virtualization;VM;VMware;virtual machine;ESX;virtual;host" />The ESX&#160;CPU&#160;Usage (Percent) alert indicates an unusually high amount of CPU usage by the ESX server hosting the virtual machine on the monitored SQL&#160;Server instance resides. The percentage of ESX&#160;server processor usage is listed under the control. A high ESX server percentage could indicate a large number of active client sessions. This alert is enabled by default and is available only on instances hosted on virtual machines enabled for VM&#160;monitoring.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Reduce your ESX&#160;CPU&#160;usage</h2>
        <p class="Body">Consistently high ESX&#160;server processor usage could indicate the need to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">Reduce the number of SQL re-compilations as they are CPU intensive. There are many reasons that an object such as a stored procedure is recompiled and you can remove most of these reasons by careful coding.
</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Make sure that all T-SQL statements (whether in a stored procedure, trigger or ad hoc statement) that reference objects fully qualify the object referenced.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">For example: <code>SELECT * FROM Northwind.dbo Employees</code> is a fully-qualified object reference whereas <code>SELECT * FROM Employees</code> is a poorly-qualified object. You can reuse the execution plans of fully-qualified objects "as is," whereas plans where you either cannot reuse the not fully-qualified objects or, if they are reused, then they are subject to a highly restrictive <code>COMPILE </code>lock while SQL Server determines if all of the objects referenced in the T-SQL code have the same owners as the execution plan currently in cache. Both of these situations consume a significant amount of CPU time.</p>
