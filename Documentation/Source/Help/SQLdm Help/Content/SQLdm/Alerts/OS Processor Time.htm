        <h1 class="Heading1">OS Processor Time (Percent) alert</h1>
        <p class="Body">The OS&#160;Processor Time (Percent) alert provides the percentage of CPU time used by all processes on the computer hosting your SQL&#160;Server instance. The WMI object <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Win32_PerfRawData_PerfOS_Processor</span> property<span style="font-variant: small-caps;"> PercentProcessorTime</span>  is measured to get percent processor time.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Reduce OS processor time</h2>
        <p class="Body">   If this value regularly exceeds 75%, you should take action such as:
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">Reduce the number of SQL re-compilations since they are CPU intensive. There are many reasons that an object such as a stored procedure is recompiled and you can remove most of these reasons by careful coding. See the SQL Re-compilations counter for ways to dramatically reduce recompiles.
</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Make sure that all T-SQL statements (whether in a stored procedure, trigger, or ad hoc statement) that reference objects fully qualify the object referenced. <br />For example: <code>SELECT * FROM Northwind.dbo Employees</code> is a fully-qualified object reference whereas <code>SELECT * FROM Employees</code> is a poorly-qualified object. You can reuse the execution plans of fully-qualified objects "as is," whereas plans where you either cannot reuse the not fully-qualified objects or, if they are reused, then they are subject to a highly restrictive <code>COMPILE </code>lock while SQL Server determines if all of the objects referenced in the T-SQL code have the same owners as the execution plan currently in cache. Both of these situations consume a significant amount of CPU time.
</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">Stop unnecessary programs (such as the Print Spooler or activities such as the database server acting as either a BDC or PDC) from running. 
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Reasons why the CPU Usage metric has no value</h2>
        <p class="Body">SQLdm is unable to collect the corresponding counter due to one of the following reasons:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">It usually takes two refreshes to begin populating the CPU&#160;Usage metric, which occurs within a few seconds.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">OS&#160;Metrics collection is disabled or not working properly. You must enable OS Metrics collection for SQLdm to collect hardware performance metrics.</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Lightweight Pooling is enabled. SQLdm cannot collect OS metrics if Lightweight Pooling is enabled on the SQL Server instance.</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">Alerts are disabled. SQLdm displays an alert status when at least one of the three alerts is enabled.</li>
            <li class="BulletLast">The counter does not exist on this SQL&#160;Server instance.</li>
        </ul>
