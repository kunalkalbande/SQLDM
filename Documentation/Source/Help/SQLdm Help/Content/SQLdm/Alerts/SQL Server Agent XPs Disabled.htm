        <h1 class="Heading1">SQL Server Agent XPs Disabled alert</h1>
        <p class="Body">The SQL&#160;Server Agent XPs Disabled alert indicates that the Agent XPs configuration option is disabled in SQL&#160;Server 2005 or later versions. The alert may also signal that  procedures are dropped in SQL&#160;Server 2000 for the SQL Server instance. Note that SQLdm does not collect SQL Agent job details. </p>
        <p class="Body">Agent XPs are disabled when SQL Server Agent is stopped. You can re-enable Agent XPs through the Server Configuration view and allow viewing of agent job histories even when the agent is not running.
