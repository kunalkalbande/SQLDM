        <h1 class="Heading1"> OS Processor Queue Length (Count) alert</h1>
        <p class="Body">The OS&#160;Processor Queue Length (Count) alert indicates that the number of threads waiting on the processor reached an alert threshold. A consistently high processor queue length can indicate processor congestion. If your system has multiple processors, you may need to increase your alert thresholds.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Reduce your OS&#160;processor queue length</h2>
        <p class="Body">If the Processor Queue Length is often high, consider making one of the following changes: 
</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Bullet">Upgrade to faster CPU(s).
</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Reduce the number of SQL re-compilations as they are CPU intensive. There are many reasons that an object such as a stored procedure is recompiled, and you can remove most of these reasons by careful coding. See the SQL re-compilations counter for ways to dramatically reduce recompiles. 
</li>
            <li class="Bullet">Stop unnecessary programs from running (such as the Print Spooler or activities such as the database server acting as either a BDC or PDC).</li>
