        </p>
        <p class="Body">The Server Configuration Properties view contains the following properties:</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Active Cluster Node</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Displays the name of the active cluster node on this monitored SQL&#160;Server instance. For more information about this setting, see <a href="Configure Cluster Settings.htm" target="_self">Configure cluster settings</a>.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Alert Refresh</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Displays the interval (in hours, minutes, and seconds) between times when the service collects diagnostic data and raises the associated alerts. Use a value between 30 seconds and 30 minutes. Lower values result in a faster triggered alert, but also cause more frequent refreshes, which may increase monitoring overhead. You can modify this setting directly in this view. Click in the appropriate field, make your change, and then click <span class="GUI_Item">Save Changes</span>. For more information about this setting, see <a href="Set general server options.htm" target="_self">Set general server options</a>.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Authentication Mode</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Displays the authentication mode used by the SQLdm Collection Service to collect diagnostic data from the monitored SQL&#160;Server instance. For more information about this setting, see <a href="Set general server options.htm" target="_self">Set general server options</a>.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Activity Monitor Enabled</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Displays whether monitoring of non-query activities is enabled. The monitoring of non-query activities captures autogrow events, deadlocks, and blocks. For more information about this setting, see <a href="Set non-query monitor options.htm" target="_self">Set activity monitor options</a>.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Baseline Date Range</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Displays the period of time over which the server baseline is calculated. For more information about this setting, see <a href="Configure server baseline options.htm" target="_self">Set server baseline options</a>.</p>

        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Displays the date range over which the server baseline is calculated. For more information about this setting, see <a href="Configure server baseline options.htm" target="_self">Set server baseline options</a>.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Changed?</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Displays an edit icon to indicate that this row includes a change from the last time the data was saved. Click <span class="GUI_Item">Save Changes</span> to retain any changes made in this view. Click <span class="GUI_Item">Reset Changes</span> to revert to the most-recently saved server configuration properties.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Check Server Accessibility</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Displays the interval (in hours, minutes, and seconds) between times when the server availability is verified. Use a value between 30 seconds and 10 minutes. If a <code>select 1</code> query cannot execute in this timeframe, then the server is considered unresponsive.  Setting your server availability check to a very low value may result in false positive alerts. You can modify this setting directly in this view. Click in the appropriate field, make your change, and then click <span class="GUI_Item">Save Changes</span>. For more information about this setting, see <a href="Set general server options.htm" target="_self">Set general server options</a>.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Database Statistics Refresh</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Displays the interval (in hours, minutes, and seconds) between times when the database space-related data is collected and associated alerts are raised. Use a value between one minute and 24 hours. Setting your database statistics refresh to a low value may result in false positive alerts. A low setting also causes refreshes to occur more often, which increases the monitoring overhead. In environments with a large number of databases whose sizes do not change rapidly, setting this refresh to a long interval can greatly reduce your monitoring footprint. You can modify this setting directly in this view. Click in the appropriate field, make your change, and then click <span class="GUI_Item">Save Changes</span>. For more information about this setting, see <a href="Set general server options.htm" target="_self">Set general server options</a>.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Deadlock Monitoring</p>

Error log alerting is considered enabled if either the SQL&#160;Server Agent Log or SQL&#160;Server Error Log alert is enabled. Note that these collectors may negatively affect performance. You can reduce the impact of error log reading by regularly cycling the server error logs. For more information about error log alerting, see <a href="Configure Alerts for Your.htm" target="_self">Configure alerts</a>.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Fragmentation Min. Table Size (KB)</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">Displays the minimum size, in kilobytes, a table must meet before fragmentation statistics are collected. Use a value between 0 KB and 999999 KB. Fragmentation statistics are only gathered on tables with clustered indexes. You can modify this setting directly in this view. Click in the appropriate field, make your change, and then click <span class="GUI_Item">Save Changes</span>.
