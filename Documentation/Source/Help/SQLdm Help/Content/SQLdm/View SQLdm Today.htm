        <h2 class="Heading2">Use SQLdm Today to view the general health of your environment</h2>
        <p class="Body">SQL diagnostic manager gives you a quick glance at the overall health of your environment in the Status section of the SQLdm Today page. The main categories of data shown in this view include the following areas:</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Status Summary</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">The Status Summary section displays the number and type of active alerts for all of your SQL&#160;Server instances. SQLdm displays a large icon that shows you at a glance the current highest level of severity of your servers accompanied by the number of your servers in that state.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Most Critical Servers</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBody">SQLdm provides a list of up to five of your most critical servers so you can quickly access that SQL&#160;Server instance and review the issue.</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Recent Servers</p>
        <p class="DefinitionListBodyLast">The SQLdm Today page provides a list of your five recently-accessed SQL Server instances, with the most recent visit appearing at the top of the list.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Get the most from SQLdm</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Get Started tab of the SQLdm Today page provides links for you to access content in the SQL diagnostic manager Trial Center including video tours that cover important features and SQLdm navigation. You can also find Webcasts, white papers, and the SQL&#160;Server Performance Blog for additional information that you may find useful when using SQLdm.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">View your recent active alerts</h2>
        <p class="Body">SQLdm displays a list of your most recent active alerts on the SQLdm Today page Active Alerts tab. While this view displays alerts for all your monitored SQL Server instances, you can <a href="View active alerts for this instance.htm">view additional alert information for a specific server instance</a> by using the right-click context menu. This additional information includes a real-time view and a shortcut to configure your alerts.</p>
        <p class="Body">If you are aware of an alert and do not want to see it in your list or have it impact the associated server, you can "snooze" or temporarily postpone the alert from appearing for a set number of minutes. When you snooze an alert, SQLdm clears the alert which no longer impacts the state of the monitored server until the snooze period expires. To snooze an alert, right-click the specific alert, and then select <span class="GUI_Item">Snooze Alert</span>. Select the appropriate number of minutes you want to alert to snooze, and then click <span class="GUI_Item">OK</span>.</p>
        <p class="StepIntro">To snooze an alert on the Active Alerts tab:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the Active Alerts tab of the SQLdm Today page, right-click anywhere on the row containing the alert you no longer want to view.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="GUI_Item">Snooze Alert</span>.</li>
            <li>Type or scroll to select the number of minutes you want the alert to snooze, and then click <span class="GUI_Item">OK</span>.</li>
        </ol>
