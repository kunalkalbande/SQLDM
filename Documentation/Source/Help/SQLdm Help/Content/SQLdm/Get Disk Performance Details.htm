            <MadCap:keyword term="Resources:disk;virtual;virtual machine;virtualization;VM;VMware;ESX;host" />The Disk tab allows you to view key statistics on the way your disks are used on the computer hosting your SQL Server instance. This allows you to analyze your disk performance for any performance bottlenecks that may be occurring. </p>
        <p class="Body">Disk information is displayed in four charts that display the drives the computer on which the SQL&#160;Server instance is located. You can pick which four charts you view by selecting from the drop-down list at the top of each chart. You can select from the following charts:</p>
