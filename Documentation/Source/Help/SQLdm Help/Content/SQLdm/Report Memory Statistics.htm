        <h1 class="Heading1">Memory Statistics</h1>
        <p class="Body">The Memory Statistics report lets you view trends for memory usage on a monitored SQL Server instance over a specified period of time.  To successfully monitor OS metrics, make sure that you enable <a href="Enable OS Metrics Monitoring.htm" target="_self">WMI or OLE automation</a> on the monitored instance. Check <span class="GUI_Item">Show Tabular Data</span> to display results in a single tabular or grid format.</p>
        <p class="Body">Check <span class="GUI_Item">Show Baseline</span>  to include baseline data points in the Memory Statistics report. For additional information about baseline configuration, see <a target="_self" href="Configure server baseline options.htm">Configure server baseline options</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">When to run this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">You should run the Memory Statistics report to analyze the memory needs of a monitored instance. This can help you identify problems with current usage or to plan for future increases in memory.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">How SQLdm calculates metric values on this report</h2>
        <p class="Body">Most values on the Memory Statistics report correlate with the related SQL Server metric.</p>
        <p class="Body">However, some metric values represent averages over time. Likewise, a few metric values are based on performance algorithms that use multiple statistics to calculate a more accurate metric.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can access our <a href="http://www.idera.com/support" target="_blank">Customer Service Portal</a> (www.idera.com/support) for more information about the algorithm used to calculate a specific metric.</p>
