        <p class="Body">The Query Monitor Signature Mode view is the place to start when investigating query performance. It broadly defines queries and trends with a less overwhelming amount of data and allows you to diagnose a query in a general sense. Once you identify a potential problem, you may want to view the <a href="View query monitor statement mode.htm">statement mode</a> view to see why a query is experiencing performance problems for a particular user, and then to the <a href="View query history.htm">query history</a> to see how the query performs over time and the associated trends.</p>
        <p class="Body">The primary focus of the Signature Mode view is in the charts. The chart type drop-down allows you to pick a chart type to view, while the chart category drop-down allows you to choose to view the data by SQL&#160;Text, Application, or Database.</p>
        <p class="Body">Use Query filters to narrow the results to only those that most interest you. Do this by selecting the date and time range, the application, user, database, workstation, and the SQL&#160;text you want to include or exclude from your results.</p>
        <p class="Body">Event Occurrences is a listing of each occurrence of the query and the associated statistics, such as the duration, CPU time, reads, writes, and associated SQL&#160;text.</p>

</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Sigma (Σ) character</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Sigma character indicates that the data in this row is at least partially composed of aggregated data. This means that the data is condensed into a day-length summary and some precision about the individual statements, client computers, and users is suppressed. Rows on this view with the Sigma character may include a mix of aggregated and non-aggregated data.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Understanding cell colors</h2>
        <p class="Body">Red in the column indicates that the data in that row represents 20 percent or more of the total data displayed in the list, while yellow indicates that the data in the row represents 5 percent or more of the total data displayed in the list.</p>
